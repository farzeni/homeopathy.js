"# Homeopathy.js" 

Homeopathy.js or hom≈ìopathy.js is a script of alternative computation developed in 2018 by Alessandro Giua, based on homeopaty doctrine of "stuff cures stuff" (similia similibus curentur), a claim that a script that causes a bug in a device would fix similar bugs in other device.

That's science bitches!
